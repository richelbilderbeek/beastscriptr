\usage{
are_mrca_align_ids_in_fasta(mrca_prior, fasta_filename)
}
\arguments{
\item{mrca_prior}{a Most Recent Common Ancestor prior,
as returned by \code{\link{create_mrca_prior}}}

\item{fasta_filename}{a FASTA filename.
Use \code{\link{get_fasta_filename}} to obtain a testing FASTA filename.
Note that BEAST2 also supports missing data,
by using a dash (\code{-}) or question mark (\code{?})
as a sequence.}
}
\value{
TRUE if all the MRCA priors' alignment IDs
  are present in the FASTA files.
  Returns FALSE otherwise
