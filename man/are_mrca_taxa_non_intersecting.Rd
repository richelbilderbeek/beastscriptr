\title{Determine if MRCA priors that are monophyletic (i.e., assume
no other taxons share a same MRCA) are compatible, that
is, there are no taxa that intersect.}
\usage{
are_mrca_taxa_non_intersecting(mrca_priors)
}
\arguments{
\item{mrca_priors}{a list of one or more Most Recent Common Ancestor priors,
as returned by \code{\link{create_mrca_prior}}}
}
\value{
TRUE if the MRCA priors are non-intersecting.
  FALSE otherwise.
}
\description{
For example, one
MRCA prior with taxon 1 and 2 is incompatible with an MRCA prior
with taxon 3 and 4
