  inference_model,
  clock_models = "deprecated",

}
\arguments{
\item{inference_model}{a Bayesian phylogenetic inference model.
An inference model is the complete model setup in which a site model,
clock model, tree prior and more are specified.
Use \link{create_inference_model} to create an inference model.
Use \link{check_inference_model} to check if  an inference model is valid.
Use \link{rename_inference_model_filenames} to rename the files in an
inference model.}

\item{clock_models}{a list of one or more clock models,
as returned by \code{\link{create_clock_model}}}

\item{mrca_prior}{a Most Recent Common Ancestor prior,
as returned by \code{\link{create_mrca_prior}}}

\item{tipdates_filename}{name of the file containing the tip dates.
This file is assumed to have two columns, separated by a tab.
The first column contains the taxa names, the second column contains
the date.}
