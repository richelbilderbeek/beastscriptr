\title{Creates the '\code{tree}' section of a BEAST2 XML parameter file}
\usage{
taxa_to_xml_tree(
  inference_model,
  id = "deprecated",
  tipdates_filename = "deprecated"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{inference_model}{a Bayesian phylogenetic inference model.
An inference model is the complete model setup in which a site model,
clock model, tree prior and more are specified.
Use \link{create_inference_model} to create an inference model.
Use \link{check_inference_model} to check if  an inference model is valid.
Use \link{rename_inference_model_filenames} to rename the files in an
inference model.}

\item{id}{an alignment's IDs.
An ID can be extracted from its FASTA filename
with \code{\link{get_alignment_ids_from_fasta_filenames}})}

\item{tipdates_filename}{name of the file containing the tip dates.
This file is assumed to have two columns, separated by a tab.
The first column contains the taxa names, the second column contains
the date.}
}
\value{
lines of XML text
}
\description{
Creates the '\code{tree}' section of a BEAST2 XML parameter file,
which is part of a '\code{state}' section,
without being indented.

\details{
The \code{tree} tag has these elements:
\preformatted{
   <tree[...]>
       <taxonset[...]>
       [...]

    </run>
